# what is operators?
# Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

# Python divides the operators in the following groups:
# Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %, **, //
# + addition
# - subtraction
# * multiplication
# / division
# % modulus
# ** exponentiation
# // floor division
# print(9%2)
# print(2**4)
# print(19//5)

# Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, **=
# a =45
# a+=45
# print(a)

# Comparison operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
# print(5>6)

# Logical operators: and, or, not
# and: Returns True if both statements are true
# or: Returns True if one of the statements is true
# not: Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true

# identity operators: is, is not
# is: Returns true if both variables are the same object
# is not: Returns true if both variables are not the same object
# a=5
# b=6
# c=a
# print(a is b)
# print(a is c)
# print(a is not b)

# Membership operators: in, not in
# in: Returns True if a sequence with the specified 
#value is present in the object
# not in: Returns True if a sequence 
#with the specified value is not present in the object

# name ='apple'
# print('a' in name)
# print('a' not in name)
# print('b' in name)
# print('b' not in name)

# Bitwise operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>

# print(5&6)
# print(bin(5))
# print(bin(6))
# print(bin(4))
